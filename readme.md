### Protocol Overview

The protocol defines a set of commands and responses for controlling the motorized ballista and managing bow-related actions.

#### Operation Codes Format

- **Format:** `<CATEGORY><ACTION><INDEX>`
- **Example:** `MUP001` (Move Up), `BTR002` (Bow Trigger)

#### Categories
- **M**: Movement
- **B**: Bow Actions
- **E**: Error

#### Actions and Index
- Actions describe the specific action or response.
- Index provides a unique identifier for actions.

### Movement Commands

#### Move Up
- **Code:** `MUP001`
- **Description:** Command to move the ballista up.
- **Response:** Acknowledgment - `MUPACK` or Error - `MUPERR`

#### Move Down
- **Code:** `MDN001`
- **Description:** Command to move the ballista down.
- **Response:** Acknowledgment - `MDNACK` or Error - `MDNERR`

#### Move Left
- **Code:** `MLF001`
- **Description:** Command to move the ballista left.
- **Response:** Acknowledgment - `MLFACK` or Error - `MLFERR`

#### Move Right
- **Code:** `MRT001`
- **Description:** Command to move the ballista right.
- **Response:** Acknowledgment - `MRTACK` or Error - `MRTERR`

### Bow Commands

#### Bow Pull
- **Code:** `BPL001`
- **Description:** Command to pull the bowstring.
- **Response:** Acknowledgment - `BPLACK` or Error - `BPLERR`

#### Bow Release
- **Code:** `BRL001`
- **Description:** Command to release the bowstring.
- **Response:** Acknowledgment - `BRLACK` or Error - `BRLERR`

#### Bow Trigger
- **Code:** `BTR001`
- **Description:** Command to trigger the bow for firing.
- **Response:** Acknowledgment - `BTRACK` or Error - `BTRERR`

### Error Responses

#### Generic Error
- **Code:** `EERR001`
- **Description:** Generic error response.
- **Cause:** Unspecified error during execution.

#### Command Error
- **Code:** `ECMD001`
- **Description:** Command not recognized or invalid.
- **Cause:** The received command is not supported or malformed.

#### Connection Error
- **Code:** `ECON001`
- **Description:** Error in the Bluetooth connection.
- **Cause:** Connection between the app and the hardware device is lost or failed.

### Example Usage

1. Sending a command to move the ballista up:
   - **App to Device:** Send `MUP001`
   - **Device to App:** Receive `MUPACK` (Acknowledgment) or `MUPERR` (Error)

2. Sending a command to pull the bowstring:
   - **App to Device:** Send `BPL001`
   - **Device to App:** Receive `BPLACK` (Acknowledgment) or `BPLERR` (Error)

3. Handling a generic error:
   - **Device to App:** Receive `EERR001` (Generic Error)

### Conclusion

This standardized protocol enables seamless communication between the mobile app and the motorized ballista hardware device. The use of alphanumeric codes for operations and errors ensures clarity and reliability in the communication process.

When implementing this protocol, make sure both the app and the hardware device adhere to the defined codes and responses to achieve consistent and effective control and feedback.
